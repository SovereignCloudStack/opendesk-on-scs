# User import

Once you have a complete deployment, you can add additional accounts via the administration interface.
For this, you can use the administrative account `default.admin`, whose credentials are provided after the deployment (see [First login](getting_started.md).

Alternatively, users can be created automatically from a source file.
The [openDesk User Importer]([openDesk User Importer](https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/opendesk/components/platform-development/images/user-import/-/tree/main)) supports both random test users and predefined users from ods files.
To keep it simple you could also use the credentials from `default.admin`.
